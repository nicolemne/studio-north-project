# Studio North

Studio North is an (imaginary) recording studio located in Northern Sweden. This studio is designed to be the perfect oasis for recording music without distractions. The website features a Home page with an 'About us' section, a Gallery page to view photos of the studio itself as well as the surroundings. The Contacts page contains the contact information for the studio, as well as a section to request a booking.

The reason I decided to go with this idea is because of my passion for music, as well as fond memories of my time as an intern in a music studio located in my hometown of Gothenburg, Sweden.

## User Experience (UX)

Visitors who wish to hire a music studio to record their own ideas should find this website modern and inticing. My goal is for the visitor to feel like this is a professional and luxury studio, with a beautiful location, and all the neccessary equipment for recording an album in a distraction-free environment.

A description about the studio is accessible on the front page, and if the visitor wants to see more visual content, the gallery page provides the viewer with an idea of what the studio looks like, as well as the surrounding area. 

If you wish to contact the studio or make a request, the contact page provides all information needed. 

The website is viewable from different screen sizes, so every user can browse the the site.

### User Stories

For first time viewers I wanted to make the website visually inticing as well as having a clear understanding what the website is about. Together with the hero image and text, side images and introduction text, the first page quickly suggests that this is a music recording studio. 

If the front page has piqued the viewers interest and they would like to learn more about the studio, they can visit the studio gallery, as well as the social media links in the footer, which are both easily accessible. 

## Design

### Colour Scheme

I've generated a color palette based off of the hero image, which I thought would be a well suited color scheme for the full website. 

[Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) Is the website I've used to generate the colour palette. I've mainly used a black background, white text and #5E4F46 for underlines, and #091B1D as the footer background.

### Typography

I wanted to go with a sleek typography, and decided to go with Bebas Neue, Pathway Gothic One and Raleway, all of which I thought fitted well together. 
We can see Raleway being used on the hero image "Studio North". Pathway Gothic One is used as paragraph text, and Bebas Neue as lesser headers.

### Imagery

As the studio is located in a rural forest area in northern Sweden, I've chosen to use images that gives a warm and earthy feel. 

### Wireframes

The Wireframes I've made was created for desktop and mobile view. The original design I made has changed slightly, and the images below represent the new changes - which I have also tried my best to implement on the live site. 

I ended up not going for the hamburger navigation menu nor the calendar button in the end and settled for just the submit button and the regular navigation menu. I also rearranged the mobile view for the Home page (index.html), showing the picture of the house first, and the about us section second in the column.

## Features

My website contains 3 pages, index.html which is the home page, gallery.html is the gallery page, and contact.html is the contact page. 

### Finished look of the Home page

### Finished look of the Gallery page
Because my screen is a little bit bigger I've had to crop the images to get full view.

![Gallery Bottom](assets/readme/gallery-page-3.jpg)

### Finished look of the Contact page

## Footer

### General features on each page

The navigation bar and footer is reappearing on all three pages of my website.

### Future Implementations

I would like to add a calendar to the contact page so a visitor can view when the studio is available to rent.

Another page with more detailed information about what hardware and software they have available at the studio, might be something I would like to add in the future too.

### Accessibility

I have tried my best to be mindful of accessibility, and the steps I've taken for this are the following:

- Descriptive information about every image in the gallery page
- Aria labels to the social media links
- Chose a good colour contrast throughout the website
- Semantic HTML

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

HTML & CSS.

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

I've used Gitpod for the actual programming, as well as creating a repository for my project in Github. 

Wireframes were created with Balsamic. 

For the iframe I've used https://google-map-generator.com/.

I've converted all images from avif files to jpg with Microsoft Paint. The header image I've also used Canva for adding a colour tint. Original header picture below.

## Testing

I have tested all the links, both in the footer and navigation menu to see that all the links are working. All links to websites open up in a new tab.
